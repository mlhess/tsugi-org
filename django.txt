Building Tsugi Applications in Django
-------------------------------------

Make an account on 

www.pythonanywhere.com

Start a shell on PythonAnywhere

cd
mkvirtualenv django2 --python=/usr/bin/python3.6
workon django2
pip install django

python3 -m django --version

git clone https://github.com/tsugiproject/djtest

cd djtest
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then create the needed database file:

python3 manage.py migrate

In the PYAW web interface navigate to the Web tab to create a new 
web application. If you have not already done so, add a new web 
application. Select manual configuration and Python 3.6. Once the 
webapp is created, you need to make a few changes to the settings 
for the web app and your application.

Create a duplicate tab in the current web browser with shell open. 
In the duplicate tab in top right corner click on the three line 
drop down and select Web. Click on Add a new web app. Click next 
until you get to Select a Python Web Framework. Select Manual 
Configuration. Select the Python version to be Python 3.6. 
Click Next to finish Manual Configuration for Web App. 


source code: /home/--your-account---/djtest
working directory: /home/--your-account---/djtest
virtualenv: /home/--your-account---/.virtualenvs/django2

Then edit the WGSI Configuration File and replace the contents of the file
with the following code:

import os
import sys

path = os.path.expanduser('~/djtest')
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, path)
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'djtest.settings'
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from django.contrib.staticfiles.handlers import StaticFilesHandler
application = StaticFilesHandler(get_wsgi_application())



Then restart your web application and attempt to go 

https://--your-account--.pythonanywhere.com/grade/

You literally should get a "403" error because it is not an LTI launch - just like
what you get when you go to:

https://djtools.tsugicloud.org/grade/

Adding to to an instance of Tsugi.  Go to (password sakaiger):

https://dev1.tsugicloud.org/tsugi/admin

Select "Manage External Tools" and "Add Tool".

The "Launch Endpoint" must be unique.  Make be your account name on pythonanywhere.
The URL for reveiving launches needs to be

https://--your-account--.pythonanywhere.com/grade/launch

Additional Settings is the JSON shown below the field.  Make *sure* to
remove the // comment after pasting it in.  Yes the field is only one line.

Test launch the tool from the TsugiCloud store:

https://dev1.tsugicloud.org/tsugi/store/

Make an account on 

https://dev1.sakaicloud.com

Make a site, add Lessons and Gradebook.

Then in Lessons, "Add Learning App" and select "Dev1" from the list.
If "Dev1" is not in the Add Learning App list have Chuck add it.

Once you are in "Add Learning App" scroll down and find your app and install
it in Lessons.

If you want to test grade flow, make sure to make a second student
account to join your site and launch your tool to send back a grade that actually
makes it to the gradebook.  Instructors can't receive grades.

Then, go back to your PythonAnywhere account, and edit the file

~/djtest/grade/templates/grade/main.html

Add your name to the <h1> tag, then go into the PythonAnywhere account Web Tab
and "Reload" your application and then re-launch it from Sakai.

Congratulations - you just built, installed, and modified a Django-based
Tsugi tool.
