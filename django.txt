Building Tsugi Applications in Django
-------------------------------------

Make an account on 

www.pythonanywhere.com

Start a shell on PythonAnywhere and run these commands:

cd
mkvirtualenv django2 --python=/usr/bin/python3.6
workon django2
pip install django==2.1.7 

We install an earlier version of Django to make sure
that the vesion of SQLite works with your Django.
Verify things worked by checing the Django version:

python3 -m django --version

git clone https://github.com/tsugiproject/djtest

cd djtest
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then create the needed database file:

python3 manage.py migrate

In the PYAW web interface navigate to the Web tab to create a new 
web application. If you have not already done so, add a new web 
application. Select manual configuration and Python 3.6. Once the 
webapp is created, you need to make a few changes to the settings 
for the web app and your application.

Create a duplicate tab in the current web browser with shell open. 
In the duplicate tab in top right corner click on the three line 
drop down and select Web. Click on Add a new web app. Click next 
until you get to Select a Python Web Framework. Select Manual 
Configuration. Select the Python version to be Python 3.6. 
Click Next to finish Manual Configuration for Web App. 

source code: /home/--your-account---/djtest
working directory: /home/--your-account---/djtest
virtualenv: /home/--your-account---/.virtualenvs/django2

Then edit the WGSI Configuration File and replace the contents of the file
with the following code:

import os
import sys

path = os.path.expanduser('~/djtest')
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, path)
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'djtest.settings'
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
from django.contrib.staticfiles.handlers import StaticFilesHandler
application = StaticFilesHandler(get_wsgi_application())


Then restart your web application and attempt to go 

https://--your-account--.pythonanywhere.com/grade/launch/

You should get redirected to an error detail page on
www.tsugi.org since this is the launch URL.

https://djtools.tsugicloud.org/grade/launch/

Adding to to an instance of Tsugi.  

https://dev1.tsugicloud.org/tsugi/admin

Enter the password "tsugi" and select "Manage External Tools" and "Add Tool".

The "Launch Endpoint" must be unique across the whole system.  The simplest thing
is to just use your account name on pythonanywhere.  The name of the tool is a title
and can have several words.

The URL for receiving launches needs to be

https://--your-account--.pythonanywhere.com/grade/launch


Here are my sample settings:

Launch endpoint: drchuck
Name of the tool: Dr. Chuck's Test
Launch URL: https://drchuck.pythonanywhere.com/grade/launch
Icon: fa-random

Set the Additional Settings to the JSON shown below the field.  Yes the field is 
only one line - the JSON will all fit and it will look better in the edit view.

Ignore the pubic key for now - it is already hard-coded into djtest for this tutorial.

Test launch the tool from the TsugiCloud store:

https://dev1.tsugicloud.org/tsugi/store/

Find your tool, click on "Details" and then "Test".  This
will test launch the tool from within Tsugi.  

Launching from an LMS
---------------------

Once this is done, you can use LTI 1.1 or LTI Advantage to launch your tool.  In the 
Tsugi store you will get the launch url to use in the LMS.  You might be able to 
use 12345/secret if the Tsugi server still had the default key for testing.
